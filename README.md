# Synology- & Portainer-samples

An official GitHub-repository for my Synology- and Portainer-based installation scripts in case you once may need one of them!

For using scripts in the "portainer"-folder, Portainer must first be installed via the "Docker"-app on the Synology-NAS (https://github.com/OliverPifferi/synology/blob/main/install_portainer_ee) and then deployed as a stack from within Portainer.

Also please take note that this is just aiming at the deploying of the single services and that reverse proxying through Synology's features including a free Let's Encrypt-certificate is the other side of the medal.

In case you have any questions, feel free to contact me via oliver(at)pifferi(dot)info.

Thanks, have fun and best regards!

Oliver
